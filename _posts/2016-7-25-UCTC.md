# Introduction:
This is the second time for us to participate in the Uchicago Trading Competition, and unfortunately, we did not end up with a high rank, again. All of our teammates are smart and har-working, the reason of our failure is that our competitors are smarter and more hard-working, most of them have very strong education background and some professinal working experience. However, that is only part of the reason, after the first competition in 2015, we did not analyze our disadvantages carefully, which enables us to make the same mistake again this year.//
So I write these posts on my blog to figure out our problems and remind myself, but also, if you are interested in this competion, it provides you with a chance to further explore it.

# How the program works:
In this competiiton, there are three cases, and each case has three rounds, those three round would be excuted in one program. In total we need to submit three programs at last, all we do in the program is fill some functions like `order()` or 'initialize', then the sever would take the functions and run them in a completed frame.//
When we were writing the code, the hoster provided a sever that we could use and test our algorithm.

# How to read these posts:
All of the three posts are extremly long, over 300 lines in one file, and they lack a lot of background details, so I do not expect readers to read it very carefully, I would try my best to explain the main structure and our algorithms, also where we made the mistake.
